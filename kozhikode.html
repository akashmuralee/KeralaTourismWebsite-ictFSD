            <h2>The City of Truth</h2>
            <p>
                From time immemorial Calicut (Kalikooth) was the most known city in the south western coast of India. Calicut traded with Romans, Arabs, Mongoles, Africans, Chinese and finally with Europeans. When we look at this uniqueness with modern mind's perception we realise that its not only because of the tactics and skills of the traders and rulers of this coast but also due to the openness, truthfulness and the compassion of the people of Calicut.The story of an Arab Merchant who left his urns and jars containing gold with the ruler of Calicut for 12 years for safe custody is a heart touching story which establishes the honesty and  truthfulness of the people and its ruler. This story very much establishes the character of the place. To supplement this story we could see here even today a magnificent  Mosque which was built by an Arab merchant centuries ago.

                Today also Calicut is a busy trading centre. The sweet meat street where you see the sweets of various tastes and colour is a promenade near beach where people of different ethnicity come together to see, experience and they carry back memories for a life time. I have always enjoyed window shopping in this street along with 'bird watching'. Every evening the street fills with the aroma of fresh coconut oil, fried banana chips, fresh ghee mixed with the fragrance of Jasmine flowers.The passion for literature, Arts, Cuisine etc...are very loud for the city of Calicut. The scholars and writers where always revered and respected by the folks of Calicut. The dynamic legacy of the scholarly court Revathi Pattathanam which was established by erstwhile Zamorin's from 14th century holds testimony to this. Pattathanam camp was a consortium of eminent scholars where their talents and potentials were tested with strict observation and rigorous evaluation. The Degree of 'Bhattar' was deemed to the best scholar of the times always. Surprisingly in the recent times the ritual/festival which where gone to ashes has been resurrected by the present generation of intellectual rigour based in Calicut. The legacy of love for literature is carried forward by the common men of Calicut even today. They are aware of the history of literature of Calicut. Their love towards the writers (Especially from Calicut) is evident in the monuments and sculptures erected in many junctions and corners of the city of Calicut.
