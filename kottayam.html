            <h2>Kottayam - City of Letters</h2>
            <p>
                Kottayam, town, southern Kerala state, southwestern India. It is situated near Vembanad Lake at the mouth of the Minachil River, south-southeast of Kochi (Cochin).
            </p>
            <p>
                An ancient town located on a hilltop bordered by the western ghats on the east and the thrilling Vembanad Lake on the west, Kottayam is a culturally rich and naturally enchanting destination. Apart from nature's bounty, the town has many laurels to its name. It is a proud town to achieve 100% literacy in India for the first time. Also being the land of several publishing houses and print media, Kottayam is also tagged as the 'Akshara Nagari' meaning 'City of letters'.The town is a centre of the Syrian Christian community, which traces its origin to the apostle St. Thomas, who is believed to have visited Kerala in 53 CE and to have established seven churches on the Malabar Coast. Kottayam developed into an important market centre in the early 20th century after tea and rubber plantations were established in the nearby Anaimalai Hills. It is also an educational and cultural centre, with several schools, including three Christian colleges (two of which are for women) and several professional colleges, all affiliated with the University of Kerala. Vembanad Lake is a popular recreation locale and is the site of a series of races each August and September between teams rowing long, narrow boats. Pop. (2001) town, 60,728; urban agglom., 172,878; (2011) town, 55,374; urban agglom., 357,302.            </p>
